Welcome to the finished code files for the [Easy Integration of FusionAuth and NodeJS](https://fusionauth.io/blog/2019/02/19/easy-integration-fusionauth-nodejs/)

This tutorial shows a brief and simple integration between FusionAuth and NodeJS. You will create an application in FusionAuth, and then use Node to create an app
that does the following: 
* Log a user in via the browser URL
* Log a user out 
* View a basic profile page
* Create & register new users to your application
* View a basic homepage 

To run this project, go into the root directory and run 

`npm install`

After the packages have installed, run 

`node index.js`

Happy hacking!
